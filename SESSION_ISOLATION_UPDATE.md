User-Specific WhatsApp Sessions Implementation
===============================================

## Changes Made:

### 1. Session Isolation
- Each user now gets their own unique WhatsApp session
- Session ID = sanitized username (e.g., "jon_fastlinegroup_com")
- No more shared sessions between users

### 2. Updated API Routes
All WhatsApp API routes now use user-specific session IDs:
- `/api/whatsapp/chats` - User's own chats only
- `/api/whatsapp/messages` - User's own messages only  
- `/api/whatsapp/send` - Sends from user's own WhatsApp
- `/api/whatsapp/session` - Manages user's own session
- `/api/whatsapp/status` - Shows user's own connection status
- `/api/whatsapp/reset` - Resets only user's own session

### 3. Admin Dashboard Enhancement
Added real-time monitoring APIs:
- `/api/admin/sessions` - Shows all active user sessions
- `/api/admin/whatsapp-status` - WhatsApp service health
- `/api/admin/ghl-connections` - GHL subaccount connections
- `/api/admin/system-stats` - System statistics

## User Impact:

### Before:
- Jon's WhatsApp account was visible to ALL users
- Shared session meant everyone saw same chats/messages
- One user's actions affected everyone

### After:
- Each user has completely isolated WhatsApp session
- Users must connect their own WhatsApp account
- No cross-user data visibility
- Actions only affect own account

## Next Steps for Users:

1. **Existing users need to reconnect WhatsApp:**
   - Go to WhatsApp Settings
   - Click "Reset Session" 
   - Scan QR code with YOUR phone
   - Your account will be isolated from others

2. **New users:**
   - Will automatically get their own session
   - Must connect their own WhatsApp account

## Technical Details:

- Sessions are stored in `./sessions/session-{username}/`
- Each session is completely independent
- WhatsApp Web.js handles multiple concurrent sessions
- Admin can monitor all sessions from admin dashboard

This fix ensures complete user isolation and privacy for WhatsApp accounts.
